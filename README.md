# Dye_et_al_sea_bass_model
Size-specific, temperature-dependent, energy budget model parameterized for the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). 
The model framework incorporates individual and population level aspects based on the consumer-resource model described by Persson et al. (1998) and the temperature-dependent scaling formulation in Karås and Thoresson (1992) and Ohlberger et al. (2011).
The population level model consists of a size-structured consumer population with ontogenetic diet shifts and an environment with three resources representing zooplankton, brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) and fish.

European sea bass dynamics shaped by more than warming seas

Abstract
`Global environmental changes are reshaping species distributions, with some species experiencing range contractions while others expand into new territories, particularly in response to rising sea temperatures. In recent decades, the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), a warm-temperate species, has expanded to higher latitudes in the NE Atlantic including the North Sea and adjacent coastal habitats, with unknown consequences to local food webs. To investigate the dynamics of range expansion, we applied a consumer-resource model representing seabass and the three key prey resources associated with its ontogenetic diet shifts, aiming to explore empirically derived expectations for seabass population trends. A marked increase in the availability of the intermediate prey resource led to model-predicted increases of 100% in total biomass and 300% in total abundance, whereas an approximate 2C rise in seasonal seawater temperature, with equal resource productivity, resulted in increases of less than 40%. We then compared our findings with a long-term, high-resolution time series (1984-2022) for European seabass in the southern North Sea to evaluate whether similar patterns were evident in the empirical data. Key features predicted by the modelincluding the timing of cohort emergence, cohort length distributions, and size class abundanceswere reflected in the long-term monitoring data. Contrary to the prevailing view that rising water temperatures primarily drive coastal ecosystem dynamics in the Anthropocene, our findings suggest that resource availability significantly influences these changes.
