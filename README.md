# Dye_et_al_sea_bass_model
Size-specific, temperature-dependent, energy budget model parameterized for the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). 
The model framework incorporates individual and population level aspects based on the consumer-resource model described by Persson et al. (1998) and the temperature-dependent scaling formulation in Karås and Thoresson (1992) and Ohlberger et al. (2011).
The population level model consists of a size-structured consumer population with ontogenetic diet shifts and an environment with three resources representing zooplankton, brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) and fish. 

## Model files
-  See the [model_files folder](https://github.com/bassdye/Dye_et_al_seabass_model/tree/main/model_files) for the model run files to conduct bifurcation and time series analysis.
    - Files for decadel temperature regimes (1980s, 2010s) are located in separate subfolders.

## Model analysis
The Escalator Boxcar Train (EBT) program package developed by [André de Roos](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/index.html) was used to conduct the model simulations.
- The EBT package software for model analysis is available [here](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/EBT/Software/index.html). 
- EBT package software documentation is available [here](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.m.deroos/EBT/Documentation/index.html).
